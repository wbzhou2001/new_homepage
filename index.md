## Short Bio

I am a Ph.D. student at [Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to have [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu) and [Peter Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yunz2/) as my advisors. Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon University, I received my B.S. in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2023. 

## Research Interests

The goal of my research is to construct end-to-end machine learning frameworks that provides data-automated solutions or insights associated with reasonable model explainability to address emerging societal challenges. To this end, I expect my research to reach out to policy makers, decision analysts, and industry researchers.

**Methodologies:** Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Applied Statistics, Operations Research<br>
**Applications:** Power Systems, Epidemiology, Seismology
