## Short Bio

My name is Wenbin Zhou, I am a Ph.D. student in Information Systems and Management at [Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to have [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu) and [Peter Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yunz2/) as my advisors. Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon University, I obtained my B.S. in Statistics at [The School of Management](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2023. 

## Research Interests

The goal of my research is to construct end-to-end machine learning frameworks that provides data-automated solutions or insights associated with reasonable model explainability to address emerging societal challenges. To this end, I expect my research to reach out to policy makers, decision analysts, and industry researchers.

**Applications:** Renewable Energy, Epidemiology, Supply Chain, Transportation System <br>
**Discipline:** Statistical Machine Learning (Trustworthy Machine Learning, Causal Inference, Large-scale Data Analytics), Operations Research (Dynammic Programming, Distributional Robust Optimization)
